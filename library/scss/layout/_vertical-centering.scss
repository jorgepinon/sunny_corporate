/*
 * The simplest, widely-supported method I found was to add three divs within a container. And that container needs to have a defined height. I know that sucks but I prefer to add html than to add javascript. Not sure why. Maybe because I hate to think of binding to the window resize event. Both options suck, really.

	<div class="box" style="height: 300px">

			<div class="middle">

					This text is vertically centered. Note that the .box container is set to 300px height for this example. You need a container with a defined height (probably adjusted with media queries as needed)
